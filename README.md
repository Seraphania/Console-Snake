# Console-Snake
Console Snake is a project I made to run the old snake game on the Console app by the programming language C#, where our snake try to get the candy to becomes bigger and bigger... I had the idea when I couldn't find the snake game on my old Nokia phone so I decided to program one myself...It was a really fun experience and I'm proud of what I did

I highly recommend running the code on the Terminal using Fullscreen mode, if you don't how to do it just press f11 while focusing on the terminal window

Run the code by 'dotnet run Program.cs', and make sure you are in the same folder

The "WASD" keys for moving and "L" to select (you can edit the input keys in the settings if you want)

Enjoy;
